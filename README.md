# utah-forge-drilling-data
Processed drilling logs from Utah FORGE deep geothermal test well (MU-ESW1) for validation of a directional drilling dynamics model and ML applications

## aggregated Pason logs (uncleaned, unfiltered)
Combined daily Pason drilling data into two continuous time-series regimes:
- Regime 1 (regime_2017-07-31_to_2017-08-26.csv): 7/31/17 - 8/26/17, depths 81-5708 ft
- Regime 2 (regime_2017-09-01_to_2017-09-13.csv): 9/1/17 - 9/13/17, depths 6507-7536 ft

Note: there's a ~800 ft data gap (5708-6507 ft) from 8/27/17 to 8/31/17 (files not in original GDR upload)
